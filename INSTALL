Wheat Plymouth theme installation
---------------------------------

Ubuntu 10.4 or greater:

  Open a terminal and run the install-ubuntu.sh script.
  If you got the textual version of Plymouth (usually it happens after
  installing NVIDIA's or AMD's proprietary video card drivers) you can fix
  it by using the script available at the following url:

Other distributions

  The weath/ directory contains all the theme files; they should be copied
  to /usr/lib/plymouth/themes/wheat. After copying you should register the
  theme, configure it as the default one and update the initial RAM disk.
  I'm sure you can find out easily how to do that within your distribution.

  If you're using Debian good chance is that the commands will be similar
  these in Ubuntu (maybe it's the other way around? ;-)), see the
  installation script for reference.
