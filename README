Wheat Plymouth theme
--------------------

This is a simple Plymouth theme based on the "Ubuntu logo" one (the default
Ubuntu Plymouth theme) featuring a wheat picture background (the "Life"
wallpaper on Ubuntu 10.10) with the "Linux" text, instead than "Ubuntu".

For installation instructions refer to INSTALL.

The script test-theme.sh is a development tool used to test the theme
without having to reboot the computer.
